# News Article Text Mining
The objective of this project is to extract and analyze text data from Medium.

this project, we aim to answer the following questions using textual analysis:

1. Given a set of attributes of an article, what is the range of shares it will get?

2. Based on the text in the articles, how would you classify articles in to different categories?

3. What factors contribute towards making an article viral?

These questions will be answered by extracting training samples of unstructured documents and the results will be projected to new text. Data preparation would include transforming text to numerical format upon which various text mining tasks would be performed by adopting a predictive framework for machine learning.

Data was acquired from the Medium website where information in stored in various categories. In Mediumâ€™s homepage there are categories such as: Home, Collections, Culture, Tech, Self, Politics, Design, Health, Popular and more. Seven categories for chosen for this analysis: Culture, Tech, Self, Politics, Science, Design, Entrepreneur and Popular. 

A web crawling process was used to extract articles from these chosen categories to obtain content and the number of shares.
